## About Me
I'm a Research Assistant in the Neuroscience Lab at Torcuato Di Tella University, working with identifying toxicity in text channels. Beyond that, I'm involved in blockchain research, particularly in the realm of zero-knowledge proofs and Ethereum.

Away from the technology, you'll catch me playing bass guitar, immersed in a good book, or hitting the pavement for a refreshing run.

## Work
- Research Assistant at [Neuroscience Lab](https://www.utdt.edu/ver_contenido.php?id_contenido=10518&id_item_menu=20132)
- Blockchain Introduction Teaching Assistant at [Torcuato Di Tella University](https://www.utdt.edu/)
> Prev Asteroid Technologies ☄️ & Instituto Humai 🤖

## Studies
- Currently studying Bachelor Degree in Digital Technology at UTDT. Planing on specializing in Blockchain and Human Behavior.

> **Why would you merge Blockchain and Human Behavior?** Because with blockchain, we may be able to build better governance systems. Perhaps the key to improved governance lies in understanding if we can create a more decentralized way of organizing our societies. The first step for that is learning more about how we behave.

## Goals
I may pursue a PhD in Science and Technology some day, not yet anyways.
