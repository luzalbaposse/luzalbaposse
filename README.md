## 🤍 About Me
I'm a Research Assistant in the Neuroscience Lab at Torcuato Di Tella University. Currently honing my skills in Data Science. Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm actively involved in blockchain research, particularly in the realm of zero-knowledge proofs and Ethereum, and I'm on a journey to learn more about developer relations.

Away from the technology, you'll catch me playing bass guitar, immersed in a good book, or hitting the pavement for a refreshing run.

> **Why would you merge Blockchain and Human Behavior?** Because with blockchain, we may be able to build better governance systems. Perhaps the key to improved governance lies in understanding if we can create a more decentralized way of organizing our societies. The first step for that is learning more about how we behave.
